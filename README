About
=====

EO4VisTrails adds spatial and temporal data access, data pre-processing and data analysis capabilities to VisTrails, the Python scientific workflow tool. This includes cloud, analytics and standards-based spatial data access.

Current data modules allow access to OGC Web Services, such as WFS, WMS, SOS, as well as other spatial data sources, including PostGIS databases and netCDF datacubes. Additional modules provides wrappers around standard R, Octave and SQL scripts for data analysis capabilities. Spatial data can be visualised using a mapping module (via the QGIS API), as well as more conventional plots, for example, for time-series and windrose data.

Parallel and distributed processing for VisTrails will also be possible via the RPyC package.

Features
========

EO4VisTrails offers a number of capabilities, including:

* Geo-Data Storage
* OGC Web Services Access
* Spatial Database and Analytics

and can combine these with additional features offered by RPyC4VisTrails, including:

* Multi Threading
* Multi Processing
* Distributed Computing

The "core" modules are those shipped with EO4VisTrails, while "extensions" can work as either stand-alone modules or be linked to core modules.
