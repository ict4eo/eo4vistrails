This is the folder for EO4VisTrails documentation.

Apart from this one, all documents are created with reStructuredText format.
See: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html

The HTML documents are in the `_build/html` directory, and can be generated
by running:
    make html
while in the `docs` directory (assuming you have Sphinx 1.0.1 or higher
installed.)
