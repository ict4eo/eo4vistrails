EO4VisTrails adds spatial and temporal data access, data pre-processing and
data analysis capabilities to `VisTrails <http://www.vistrails.org/>`_, the
Python scientific workflow tool. This includes cloud, analytics and
standards-based spatial data access.

Current data modules allow access to OGC Web Services, such as WFS, WMS, SOS,
as well as other spatial data sources, including PostGIS databases and
netCDF datacubes. Additional modules provides wrappers around standard R,
Octave and SQL scripts for data analysis capabilities.

Spatial data can be visualised using a mapping module (via the QGIS API),
as well as more conventional plots, for example, for time-series and
windrose data.
