        """Fetches rows from a Bigtable.

        Retrieves rows pertaining to the given keys from the Table instance
        represented by big_table.  Silly things may happen if
        other_silly_variable is not None.

        Args:
            big_table:
                An open Bigtable Table instance.
            keys:
                A sequence of strings representing the key of each table row
                to fetch.
            other_silly_variable:
                Another optional variable, that has a much longer name than
                the other args, and which does nothing.

        Returns:
            A dict mapping keys to the corresponding table row data
            fetched. Each row is represented as a tuple of strings. For
            example:

            {'Serak': ('Rigel VII', 'Preparer'),
             'Zim': ('Irk', 'Invader'),
             'Lrrr': ('Omicron Persei 8', 'Emperor')}

            If a key from the keys argument is missing from the dictionary,
            then that row was not found in the table.

        Raises:
            IOError: An error occurred accessing the bigtable.Table object.
