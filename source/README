README
======

This directory contains the source files for the eo4vistrail documentation.

The documents are text files, designed to be used by the Sphinx program
(http://sphinx.pocoo.org) to "auto generate" readable documentation from
both the Python source code, as well as the text files themselves.

All documents are in reStructedText format
(http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html),
as is the inline documentation in the Python source code.

Assuming that Sphinx is installed, the documents can be generated by executing:
`sphinx-build -b html . ../build` from within this directory.

In order to prevent errors, VisTrails needs to be first added to the sys.path;
the `conf.py` file must therefore be modified for your specific setup.
